- 👋 Hi, I’m @Core-Sage
- 👀 I’m interested in ... CyberSecurity and Web Development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... the latter one I'm interested in.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... something in the future.
- 📫 How to reach me ... you have to reach the summit of Mount Weixin and travel the Cementery of Swords and Spears before reaching the Shrine of Living Wood where I currently stay.
- 😄 Pronouns: ... I'm straight so he/him ... in the day.
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I have so many female friends that other thinks I'm gay but they don't know that I have something for them sooner or later. (maniacally laughs)

That's all you have to know abput me ... for now.
